The SparkFun Qwiic RFID Reader is a simple I-squared-C based RFID Reader. 
It can hold up to 20 unique RFID tag IDs and their scan times, while also
providing an interrupt pin for easy on the fly tag ID retrieval. The SparkFun
Qwiic RFID Reader Arduino Library gives easy to use functions to get scanned
RFID tag IDs, their scan times, or getting all 20 IDs at once and their scan
times. Better yet, each function is demoed in the provided example code!
